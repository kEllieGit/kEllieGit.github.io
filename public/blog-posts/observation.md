I made an I'm on Observation Duty clone. It's called **Observation** and is available for you to go play [right now!](https://sbox.game/spoonstuff/observation) The name is a working title and may change in the future.

## How do I play?
The goal of the game is simple; observe security cameras and report anomalies by hovering over them and holding left click. You win after the clock reaches 6AM. You lose if too many anomalies are active at the same time. Where these games differ from the usual spot-the-difference genre of games is that they are horror games. As the time goes on gradually spookier and crazier anomalies start happening, and I'm a big fan of the original games by Notovia. I recommend checking them out on steam.

## Art and assets
I snagged 2 re-creations of gmod maps meant for TTT from the backend created by Three Thieves to use for the current maps because I'm not a mapper, the maps work and look absolutely perfect for the game. I want to have fully custom scene system only maps for the game in the future, but since I'm currently not skilled enough and this is currently strictly a solo project, they will have to stay for at least the near future. If you're a mapper and want to create custom maps for the game, please contact me on Discord.

I'm not an artist. I could barely draw a stick man right now if my life depended on it. I gnabbed a bunch of sounds from freesound.org with CC0 and some assets from the s&box backend. I know the s&box backend is a legal minefield right now, so things might change in the future. I don't think they will for at least a while, but it's just a heads up for the future.

## I want to help!
If you wish to contribute your help to making the game, the code is [open source](https://github.com/kelliegit/sbox-observation), you can clone it and help if you're a programmer. If you're an artist or mapper wishing to contribute, **please contact me** on Discord or by emailing me at kelliebusiness2@gmail.com. I'd love to feature your work as long as it fits the style and mood of the game!

I can't offer compensation at this moment in time, but monetization for the game is on and in the future if it turns profitable enough I am more than willing to offer fair compensation for any hard work done.

## The future
The game is playable. Most major bugs I am aware of are being fixed. If you have feedback, bug reports, or just want to join the community to talk about the game, my discord server is open and we have a forum dedicated to the game. You can join us [here!](https://discord.gg/kKU6a4AYNk)

The plan is to keep working on the game and release updates relatively frequently. At the time of writing I am working on the second map and adding a whole bunch of new anomalies to the game.

Please look forward to that <3
