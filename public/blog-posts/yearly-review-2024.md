Today is my birthday! I was born on the 15th of January 2004, which makes me **21** today. Happy birthday to me ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Starting today, I plan to release a yearly blog post reflecting on the past year, sharing updates about my life, and discussing the progress of my personal projects. This serves as both a writing exercise and a way to keep you informed. It is my hope to keep anyone interested as up-to-date as possible with me and my projects so that there isn't any confusion. This is another way of accomplishing this goal.

Today I primarily wish to talk about what my plans are for each of my personal projects in 2025.

## SlenderBox
I want to keep working on SlenderBox. 

Unfortunately, it's probably at the bottom of my priority list for a while. The reason for this is that if I were to go back to work on it at this point in time, I would prefer to refactor and change a ton of the internals.

I was rather stupid when I was working on the latest updates, and there are better ways of handling them now that I was not aware of when I was writing them.

SlenderBox will return, most likely sometime mid-2025.

## VNBase
I released the next major breaking update to VNBase & VNScript yesterday. It's a major update because old scripts will not work. I wanted to be done with it a week or two earlier, but I kept running into annoying issues, which are now mostly fixed!

Here's a quick list of several of the changes:
- The music keyword has been added.
- Skipping has been added.
- The base settings panel has been added.
- Sound and background images must now be strings.
- You can now define the mixer you wish to use for sounds.
- The base UI has been completely redesigned.
- A bunch of updated internals.
- And more I may have forgotten to include!

The release will be available later today on the GitHub repository. The library version is already on the latest release and can be updated to at any time.

I did a ton of things for VNBase in 2024, and the plan is to keep updating it for as long as I keep actively using it.

## Untitled RPG Game
Untitled RPG Game is my dream game. I plan to put as much of my effort and love into it as I can. This is why I do not believe that it will see a full release until probably at least ~2027.

Yep, you heard that right, I plan to work on it for the years to come! I have a TON of ideas and goals for it, and I want to make it the best game that I possibly can.

The plan right now is to work on the demo version as a showcase for the type of experience I want to provide, which I hope to be done by sometime mid-2025 or even earlier. A lot of the progress has been good so far, but there is still a lot to do. Please look forward to it!

# Conclusion
2024 was kind of a mess of a year for me personally, but the future looks very bright. Here's to a good year, let's make it count!
